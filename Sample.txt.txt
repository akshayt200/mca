Replace "sample.txt" with the path to the text file you want to search in.
Replace "word_to_search" with the word you want to search for.
The program reads the file line by line, splits each line into words using whitespace as a delimiter, and then counts the occurrences of the search word, ignoring case and any punctuation. It then displays the number of occurrences of the search word in the file.
